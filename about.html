				My name is Blake Beran. I am a senior at UNO, and I am an undergraduate in Management Information Systems. Currently, I am a year-round intern at Union Pacific. 
				My primary duties are Level 1 tech support for railroad employees, contractors and retirees across the country. I've also started picking up projects where I 
				analyze ticket data, look for trends, then report them to my boss with any solutions I come up with. Throughout my education and professional career, I've
				learned HTML/CSS, C, Java, SQL, and have started Python and PowerShell. 
				
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
				In my free time (like many studying IT), I enjoy playing video games online with friends. Along with that, I love keeping up to date with tech news and love 
				discussing computer hardware. My other interests include cooking, singing and exercising. I currently live in a house with two of my best friends and our dog, 
				a one year old black lab named Loki.
